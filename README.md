# Study Saturdays: Week 3 - React-Redux

## **Objective:** Build an app to display students and their test scores
- [x] **Cycle 0:** Build the store
- [x] **Cycle 1:** `connect` the React component
- [x] **Cycle 2:** Set up React Router for a "single student" view ⭐️
- [ ] **Cycle 3:** Make the single student route functional
- [ ] **Cycle 4 (Bonus):** Delete a student

## Steps

- [ ] Add a `<Link>` under each student's info in the `StudentList` component
  - Each link will display the text "View Detail"
  - Clicking the `<Link>` will change to URL to `/students/<student id here>`
- [ ] Make sure to write a `<Route>` to match
  - See the `<Main>` component for a space to put your `<Route>`
- [ ] Test it out! Clicking "View Detail" should show dummy data for a single student
- [ ] Once done and tested, `git checkout cycle-3`
